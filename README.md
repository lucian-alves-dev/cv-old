This is the source code of my online resume.

Some things you should know about this project:
- Based on HTML5, CSS3 and ES7 JS standards (which means no ancient browser support)
- Built with no third party plugins, templates or frameworks such as jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.
- Has multilingual support. It's currently written in English (default) and Portuguese and auto selects the language based on the browser config.

Feel free to use this repository as a base to make your own resume as you like. Just don't forget to mention my name and link my github page on the credits, ok? ðŸ˜‰

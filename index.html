                    I got my first job as a developer in december of 2016, working as a
                    full stack PHP developer for a payment terminal company called
                    <a href="https://europag.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Europag</a>. <br><br>

                    In feburary of 2018 I got a new job at
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dsintecnologia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DSIN Technology</a>,
                    an IT company specialized in solutions for traffic fines management. Besides working as a PHP developer,
                    I have also developed the front-end of
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.bmtisolucoes.estacionelegal">Estacione Legal</a>, 
                    an app used for public parking management in many cities across Brazil.

                    was also developed by me (and you can actually see me holding a phone
                    in one of the site's banners). <br><br>

                    Yet in november of 2018, I've decided to leave DSIN and work for
                    <a href="https://proponto.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Próponto</a>,
                    a solution developer company for incentive campaigns. Once again working with full stack PHP,
                    there were many projects I took part in: from promotional microsites to large incentive
                    management platforms used by national and multinational companies such as

                    Back in 2009, when I was only 16, I got the very fisrt professional job of my life
                    working as a instructor in a small computer training school. It was a pretty enriching experience
                    where I developed not only my comunication skills, but also my passion for teaching. I left
                    the job in 2011. <br><br>
                    In 2020 came up the opportunity to work as a teacher in
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/devisate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ETEC Antonio Devisate</a>,
                    a public specialty school <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7cPJ43qDuxhmdHCw6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">in Marília.</a> 
                    Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all my classes were remote until october of 2021.
                    Throughout my carrer in ETEC I taught several topics from basic computer usage (like Microsft Office) to
                    advanced programming (like developing a web application with Laravel) for more than 100 students
                    from different courses, either by video or in-person lessons.

                    From mid 2011 to 2014, I worked as a clerk at

                    Besides serving the clients, I was also responsible for software
                    and hardware maintenance of the company's and clients' computers. Though this kind
                    of service is not my main activity anymore, I still doing some computer maintenance
                    jobs eventually.

                    Courses with emphasis on programming like System Analysis and Development are known
                    to be tough and that was no different in Fatec. In my class, out of 40 students only
                    8 (including me) made it to got the diploma. <br>
                    My Degree Final Project was a financial management desktop app for a small company located

            <p>
                I built this web page entirely from scratch with no use of third party plugins, layouts or frameworks.
                That means 100% of the code here was implemented solely by me and that was on purpose. <br>
                In adition to a interactive résumé, this page is also intended to show you how I code
                in front-end enviroments. Just start inspecting this page with the Dev Tools of your browser if you
                are insterest in seeing my HTML/CSS/JS skills implemented for real. <br>
                No minification or obfuscation was made so you can inspect the page with easiness. <br>
                If you wanna see more of my code work, please visit my github page at:
